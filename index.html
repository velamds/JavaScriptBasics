        <h1>Hi, I'm Sergio David Munoz Vela</h1>
        <p>Senior Software Engineer, 8 years of professional experience in .NET, C#, PHP, Laravel, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, and CI/CD environments. I have front-end skills with JavaScript, Vue.js, React. I've worked in fully English-speaking environments, developing efficient algorithms and improving existing functionality. Additionally, I have experience as a software development teacher.

I have been responsible for developing, testing, and maintaining software solutions to
create efficient and scalable applications. This has included collaborating with crossfunctional teams to align technical solutions with business goals and designing systems with scalability, maintainability, and performance in mind. I have also reviewed code for quality, written unit tests, and troubleshot and resolved issues as they have arisen. In addition to coding, I have managed version control and ensured
smooth deployments while documenting technical aspects for both internal and external stakeholders. Continuous learning has been important to me, so I have stayed updated with industry trends.</p>
